Seller Abuse prevention


Real-time case study: Seller Abuse Prevention for a marketplace like Amazon.

Using Python, SQL, and ML, I built a Medallion Architecture pipeline to detect patterns like fake reviews, price manipulation, and suspicious sellers.

âœ… 61% sellers flagged
âœ… â‚¹1.7M at-risk revenue
âœ… Clustering, Chi-square tests, EDA, and KPI tracking

ðŸ“Š Visuals + SQL + Business Insights = Real Business Analyst Thinking
